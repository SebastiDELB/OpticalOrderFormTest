# OpticalOrderFormTest

This MVP project serves as the basis for a demonstration. 

It consists of a project library to easily package it and a console project to demonstrate its use.

Its current use is strict: to display the details of a file passed through the recognition API and to display global statistics on all the files in the directory associated with the project.

Before using it, change the destination paths: of the directory where the files, related to the project, are stored and of the file to be analysed in more detail.

Operation: after changing the paths, launch the console application.
The detailed analysis of the file should appear and then wait for the library to analyse all the files in the directory.
